## Peptide Toolkit

The Peptide class provides a suite of methods for analyzing and manipulating peptide sequences. It allows you to generate random peptide sequences, calculate various physicochemical properties, and validate amino acid compositions. This class is ideal for researchers and developers working with peptide data in bioinformatics and computational biology.

## Features
* Sequence Handling: Store and manage peptide sequences.
* Random Sequence Generation: Create random peptide sequences of specified lengths.
* Physicochemical Calculations: Compute molecular weight, hydrophobicity, aliphatic index, instability index, charge at pH, isoelectric point, extinction coefficient, GRAVY, and aromaticity.
* Sequence Validation: Ensure sequences contain only valid amino acid residues.
* Amino Acid Composition: Retrieve the composition of each amino acid in the sequence.
